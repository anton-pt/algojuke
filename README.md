# AlgoJuke

AlgoJuke is an algorithmic jukebox designed to help you discover new music
fitting to your music tastes and current mood. It creates playlists which tell
a story using the lyrics to help you connect with your music more deeply.

You can manage your library of familiar music. It creates playlists based on
natural language input and/or anchor tracks, along with an explore/exploit
setting determining how much of the music comes from your own library.

Happy listening!
