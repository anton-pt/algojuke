# Specification Quality Checklist: Personal Music Library Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details:
- ✓ Specification contains no implementation details (no mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or APIs)
- ✓ All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✓ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (defined in terms of user-observable metrics like time, percentages)
- ✓ User scenarios are comprehensive with clear acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then format
- ✓ Edge cases are identified and documented
- ✓ Scope is clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- ✓ Dependencies (001-tidal-search) and assumptions are clearly stated
- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
